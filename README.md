The official challenge is presented below. Inlcuded are the tutorial videos reccommended to familiarize the user with the concept of manipulating drive pulse to excite a qubit from ground to excited state.

IBM Technical Challenge
Qiskit Pulse allows you to program real quantum computers at the pulse level. Namely, it provides a language for specifying the microwave control tones (i.e. control of the continuous time dynamics of input signals) that program the quantum state. 

In most quantum algorithms/applications, computations are carried out over a 2^n-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by {|0>,|1âŸ©}^n, where n is the number of qubits. In IBM's quantum hardware, however, there also exists higher energy states which are typically avoided. (e.g. the single qubit "DRAG" pulse helps reduce unintentionally occupation in the |2> state).

In this challenge we want you to use Qiskit Pulse to explore the higher energy states, and put together a unique project which shows how that higher energy state directly benefits or makes your idea possible.
